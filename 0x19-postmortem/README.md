Impact:

The web app decided to play hide-and-seek, leaving 30% of our users in suspense. Some reported slow response times, and 10% experienced the thrill of intermittent errors while trying to access their favorite application.

Root Cause:

Our load balancer, clearly moonlighting as a comedian, played a prank with its configuration, causing servers to dance to different beats and leaving users tapping their feet impatiently.

Timeline:

02:30 PM: Monitoring system shouted, "Houston, we have a problem!" as error rates went through the roof.

02:35 PM: Automated alerts reached the operations team, sounding like a toddler throwing a tantrum.

02:40 PM: Initial investigation pointed fingers at the application servers â€“ suspicion of code rebellion or server overload. Turns out, they were innocent.

03:00 PM: Operation "Blame the Network" commenced. DDoS protection was summoned to the stage.

03:30 PM: DDoS protection, feeling a bit left out, decided to join the chaos. Meanwhile, users started questioning if they accidentally entered the Upside Down.

04:00 PM: Network engineering team got a standing ovation as they joined the troubleshooting party.

04:15 PM: DevOps team stole the spotlight, revealing the load balancing misconfiguration as the culprit.

04:45 PM: Load balancer received a stern talk about playing pranks. Configuration was fixed, and the curtain closed on our little circus.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

Our load balancer was the ringmaster, orchestrating a chaotic performance by misconfiguring and unevenly distributing traffic among the backend servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Automated Load Balancer Checks: Load balancer now attends regular check-ups to ensure it's not planning another surprise party.

Enhanced Monitoring: Monitoring tools got a makeover, now dressed in detective attire to uncover anomalies and expose misbehaving servers.

Documentation Review: Load balancing documentation underwent a makeover â€“ no more hiding the important stuff in fine print.

Tasks:

Load Balancer Configuration Review: Scheduled a thorough review, ensuring our load balancer doesnâ€™t sneak in any more misconfigurations.

Automated Load Balancer Testing: Load balancer will now undergo a series of rigorous tests â€“ no more flying under the radar.

Training and Awareness: Teams received a crash course in load balancing humor â€“ turns out, laughter is the best medicine for technical hiccups.
